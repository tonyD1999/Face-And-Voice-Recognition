# Data
Drive folder consists of face pictures (100 pictures/person) , voices (3 records/person) and augment-voices:
```sh
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10WNFsQ3HEmw85ib2IarELRjeKVufizjL?usp=sharing
```

# Face
### 1.Capture Face:
```sh
python record_face.py -n name -c 100
```
- -n: input your name or ids
- -c : number of faces it will capture

Our recognition model is 1:N (N is larger than 1) so you should record 2 or more people.
### 2.Encode faces to 128 dimensions-vector:
```sh
python encode_face.py
```
### 3.Train your models:
```sh
python train_faces.py
```

### 4.Run face recognition demo:
```sh
python face_recognition.py
```

# Voice
### 1.Choose your mic:
```sh
python testmic.py
```
It will show available mics in your computer:
```sh
Input Device id  0  -  Microsoft Sound Mapper - Input
Input Device id  1  -  Microphone Array (Realtek High
Input Device id  2  -  Stereo Mix (Realtek High Defini
Input Device id  3  -  Microphone (DroidCam Virtual Au
```
Then choose your mic id.

### 2.Record voice:
Default mic:
```sh
python record.py -n name -c 3
```
With your chosen mic:
```sh
python record.py -n name -c 3 -m 1
```
- -n : input your name or id
- -c : number of records it will record
- -m : input your mic id , for example 1, which is Microphone Array

It will record your voice. In this step, you should say your name (e.g Nguyen Sy Duc).
Our recognition model is 1:N (N is larger than 1) so you should record 2 or more people.
### 3.Make your records longer:
```sh
python make_more.py
```
It will merge your records to make them longer which will make model perform well because of our model works well on 5s to 30s record.

### 4.Encode your voice to 256 dimensions-vector:
```sh
python encode.py
```
### 5.Train your models:
```sh
python train.py
```
### 6.Run voice recognition demo:
Default mic:
```sh
python main.py
```
With your chosen mic:
```sh
python main.py -m 1
```
You should choose the same mic which you used to record voices.

#### Note:
- if you want to train on new data, you should clear data folder and remove all pickle files
